        <h1>Sauerkraut</h1>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from &nbsp<a  target = "_blank" href = "https://natashaskitchen.com/homemade-sauerkraut-recipe-kvashenaya-kapusta/"><em>Natasha's Kitchen</em></a></p>
        <p>This tastes nice on its own but I prefer it served as Sauerkraut Apple Salad (see below).</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 medium/large cabbage (the lighter in colour the better)</li>
                <li>2 carrots, grated</li>
                <li>1 TBSP fine sea salt</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove outer leaves of cabbage, quarter and finely shred (using a mandolin is easiest).  Discard the core.</li>
                <li>Place the cabbage, grated carrot, sugar and salt into a large bowl.  Scrunch and knead the ingredients together for around 5 minutes until lots of water is released.</li>
                <li>Fill a glass jar with the cabbage mixture, pushing it in tightly so the cabbage is all covered by the liquid. Ensure the jar is only around 2/3 full to give the mixture room to expand.</li>
                <li>Make a press over the cabbage using a small plate or lid and weight it down with a jar filled with water or a clean rock.</li>
                <li>Put a lid on the jar but do not tighten (I remove the rubber seal from a kilner jar).</li>
                <li>Let stand at room temperature for 4 days until sour, it will stop rising / fermenting when its done.</li>
                <li>Each day while it is fermenting poke a few holes into the cabbage with the back of a wooden spoon to allow the air bubbles to release.  Press the cabbage back down tightly.</li>
                <li>After 4 days, refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
